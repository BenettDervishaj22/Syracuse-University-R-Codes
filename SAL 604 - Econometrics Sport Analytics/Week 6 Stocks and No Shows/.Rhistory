# The ADF Unit Root Test for NASDAQ concludes a t-statistic of -1.3918, with a 5% critical value of -3.41. Therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis, which confirms that NASDAQ is non-stationary in this model.
summary(ur.df(stocks$Callaway,c("trend"),lags=1))
# The ADF Unit Root Test for Callaway concludes a t-statistic of -2.2572, with a 5% critical value of -3.41. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, which confirms that Callaway is non-stationary in this model.
summary(ur.df(stocks$Caesars,c("trend"),lags=1))
# The ADF Unit Root Test for Caesars concludes a t-statistic of -2.1381, with a 5% critical value of -3.41. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, which confirms Caesars is non-stationary in this model.
